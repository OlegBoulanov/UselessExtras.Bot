# UselessExtras.Bot
Minimalistic study of Telegram bots and .Net Core, using Mac OS and Visual Studio Code

The only item not under source control:
~/.telegram/uselessextras file, containing Telegram bot token, which shouldn't be public, right? Make your own bot/token to play with the code, using @BotFather's /newbot command.

Opening, building, and debugging in Visual Studio Code:
- open project folder and proceed!

Building in command line:
- dotnet restore
- dotnet build
- dotnet run

Starting chat in Telegram:
- in any chat, type @uselessextrasbot ... and select the only item in the popup menu
