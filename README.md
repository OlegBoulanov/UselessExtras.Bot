# UselessExtras.Bot
Minimalistic study of building Telegram bots in C#/.Net Core, using Telegram.Bot library by Robin MÃ¼ller. 
Built in Visual Studio Code on Mac OS X.

The only item not under source control:
~/.telegram/uselessextrasbot file, containing Telegram bot token, which shouldn't be public, right? Make your own bot/token to play with the code, using @BotFather's /newbot command.

Opening, building, and debugging in Visual Studio Code:
- open project folder and proceed!

Building in command line:
- dotnet restore
- dotnet build
- dotnet run

Starting chat in Telegram:
- in any chat, type @uselessextrasbot ... and select the only item in the popup menu
