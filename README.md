# UselessExtras.Bot
Minimalistic study of building <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/">Telegram bots</a> in C#/<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core">.NET Core</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/MrRoundRobin/telegram.bot/tree/master/src/Telegram.Bot">Telegram.Bot library by Robin MÃ¼ller</a>. 
Built in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> on Mac OS X.

The only item not under source control:
~/.telegram/uselessextrasbot file, containing Telegram bot token, which shouldn't be public, right? Make your own bot/token to play with the code, using @BotFather's /newbot command.

Opening, building, and debugging in Visual Studio Code:
- open project folder and proceed!

Building in command line:
- dotnet restore
- dotnet build
- dotnet run

Starting chat in Telegram:
- in any chat, type @uselessextrasbot ... and select the only item in the popup menu
